  metric-labels-allowlist:
    type: string
    description: |
      Comma-separated list of additional Kubernetes label keys that will be
      used in the resource' labels metric. By default the metric contains only
      name and namespace labels. To include additional labels provide a list of
      resource names in their plural form and Kubernetes label keys you would
      like to allow for them (e.g., '=namespaces=[k8s-label-1,k8s-label-n,...],pods=[app],...').
      A single '*' can be provided per resource instead to allow any labels,
      but that has severe performance implications (e.g., '=pods=[*]').
