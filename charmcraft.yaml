      type: string
      description: |
        Comma-separated list of metrics to be exposed. This list comprises of
        exact metric names and/or regex patterns. The allowlist and denylist are
        mutually exclusive.

        Comma-separated list of metrics not to be enabled. This list comprises of

      default: ""
    metric-labels-allowlist:
      type: string
      description: |
        Comma-separated list of additional Kubernetes label keys that will be
        used in the resource' labels metric. By default the metric contains only
        name and namespace labels. To include additional labels provide a list of
        resource names in their plural form and Kubernetes label keys you would
        like to allow for them (e.g., '=namespaces=[k8s-label-1,k8s-label-n,...],pods=[app],...').
        A single '*' can be provided per resource instead to allow any labels,
        but that has severe performance implications (e.g., '=pods=[*]').
      default: ""

      type: string
      description: |
        Comma-separated list of namespaces to limit monitoring to.
